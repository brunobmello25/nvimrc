# Bruno's nvimrc

my personal neovim config. This is a rewrite
from my [old config](https://github.com/brunobmello25/skeleton.nvim),
using [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim)
as a starting point

# Keymaps

You can use `:Telescope keymaps` to see all the keymaps, but the most important ones are:

- `<leader>ff` to search for files
- `<leader>fg` to search for content with grep
- `<leader>fF` to search for files and include hidden files
- `gd` go to definition
- `gI` go to implementation
- `gr` go to references
- `<leader>rn` rename symbol
- `<leader>.` code actions
- `-` open [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) (my file manager of choice)
- `<leader>ha` to harpoon a file
- `<leader>hh` to show harpoon menu
- `<leader>1` to `<leader>9` to switch between harpoon files
